## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration for creating this project

Iâ€™m currently enrolled in 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (Udemy) and this is the courseâ€™s #49th project. The original project only involved saving the post or applying to it, but I went a bit further and decided to filter the data and email me a summary of it.

## ðŸ‘€ About the project

My criteria for filtering and formatting the job offers were based on:

- Mentioned programming languages description: Looked for languages I was familiar with and saved those who were found in text. Colored Python in turquese for outstanding in email
- Work Modality: Since I'm main interested in remote positions or nerby me, I added a computer emoji to text when found a Remote position and and office emoji when not.
- Level, Location and Published Date: Outstanded each job detail into a bulled list in email
- Link: Added link to job offer for further reference and avoiding adding full job description into email
